After Reviewing the class material, I found the assignment to be straightforward. I initially created the code using “SynthDef”, and it worked properly. However, I realized that the character count exceeded 140, and didn’t need to use SynthDef so I removed it to reduce the number of characters.

For the sound source, I experimented with several different generators, and ended up with “PSinGrain”. I like that “PSinGrain” allows me to define the duration of the grain.

For effects, I used FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and allocated a buffer to the synth by using “LocalBuf”. I also tried several FFT objects, and ultimately chose “PV\_Diffuser”, which applies random phase shifting. To introduce randomness, I used “PinkNoise” to set new random values. 

In row 7, I inverted the FFT back to a signal using “IFFT”, and duplicated it by 2 to increase loudness. 

I didn’t encounter any technical difficulties, but one common mistake I made was forgetting to add ; at the end of lines of code. Fortunately, I was able to identify and correct this by myself. Every piece of code I used for this assignment was based on the example code from SC’s help browser.
